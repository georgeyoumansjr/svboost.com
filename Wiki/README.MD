# SEAnalytics Wiki

This directory will function as a Wiki repository for us to
store our knowledge base. In here we can store business logic descriptions,
HOW-TOs and decisions we take in the SEAnalytics project.

All files in this repository should be an `.md` file, which enable us to use
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax to format
the documents included in here.
